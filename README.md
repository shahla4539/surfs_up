## Overview of the statistical analysis:

W. Avy wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results:

### The list of temperatures for the month of June.

It's clear from the analysis that Oahu is a great location for the new surf shop. Upon query about how many stations are being used to collect this information, I run a query on the SQLite database to find this information quickly.
